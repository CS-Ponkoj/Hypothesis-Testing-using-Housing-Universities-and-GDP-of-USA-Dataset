# Hypothesis-Testing-using-Housing-Universities-and-GDP-of-USA-Dataset
I Used scipy.stats.ttest_ind which is a two-sided test for the null hypothesis that 2 independent samples have identical average (expected) values. This test assumes that the populations have identical variances by default. I used three datasets for these hypothesis testing such as Zillow research data site there is housing data for the United States, from the Wikipedia page on college towns is a list of university towns in the United States and from Bureau of Economic Analysis, US Department of Commerce, the GDP over time of the United States in current dollars , in quarterly intervals.
